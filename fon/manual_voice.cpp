MAN_BEGIN (U"Voice 5. Comparison with other programs", U"ppgb", 20100330)
INTRO (U"Voicing, jitter, and shimmer measurements made by Praat cannot always be compared directly with those made by other "
	"programs such as MDVP. The causes are the voicing decision strategy and the accuracy of period and peak determination.")
ENTRY (U"5.1. Voicing decisions: slightly different")
NORMAL (U"Different programs use very different methods for deciding whether an irregular part of the signal is voiced or not. "
	"A comparison of @@Boersma (1993)@ for Praat and @@Deliyski (1993)@ for MDVP leads to the "
	"following considerations. Both Praat and MDVP use an autocorrelation method for "
	"pitch analysis, but MDVP quantizes the amplitudes into the values -1, 0, and +1 before computing "
	"the autocorrelation, whereas Praat uses the original amplitude. Also, Praat corrects "
	"the autocorrelation function by dividing it by the autocorrelation function of the window, "
	"unlike any other program. Lastly, Praat uses sinc interpolation to compute an accurate "
	"estimate of the height of the autocorrelation peaks, unlike any other program. "
	"All three of these differences (and there are more) influence the measurement of the height "
	"of the autocorrelation peak at 1/F0. This height is generally taken as a criterion for voicing: "
	"if it is more than the %%voicing threshold% (which you can change with @@Pitch settings...@, "
	"the frame is considered voiced, otherwise voiceless. "
	"In Praat, the standard voicing threshold is 0.45, in MDVP it is 0.29, which suggests that MDVP "
	"tends to regard more frames as voiced than Praat. But the difference between these two numbers "
	"may partly be explained by the fact that MDVP does not correct the autocorrelation function and that MDVP "
	"does not do an accurate sinc interpolation: both of these properties cause "
	"the measured height of the peak at 1/F0 (in MDVP) to be lower than the real height, as explained by @@Boersma (1993)@.")
ENTRY (U"5.2. Jitter measurements: sometimes very different")
NORMAL (U"The jitter measures in various programs may yield different results, with Praat often giving much lower values than MDVP, "
	"especially for noisy sounds. I will now explain where the difference comes from. "
	"A more elaborate explanation with pictures is given in @@Boersma (2009a)@.")
NORMAL (U"If a sound is computer-generated as a glottal source signal with a random period duration variation of 1 percent (around a constant F0), "
	"then filtered with the characteristics of a vocal tract configuration corresponding to a sustained vowel, "
	"both Praat and MDVP will measure this sound as having a \"jitter\" of 1 percent. "
	"For non-noisy jittery sginals, therefore, the two programs give equally accurate results.")
NORMAL (U"If a sound is computer-generated as a glottal source signal with a constant period, "
	"then filtered with the characteristics of a vocal tract configuration corresponding to a sustained vowel, "
	"both Praat and MDVP will measure this sound as having a \"jitter\" of less than 0.01 percent. "
	"The two programs, therefore, have a comparable sensitivity in measuring small jitter values.")
NORMAL (U"So far, the two programs give comparable results. The difference between the two programs comes when noise is added.")
NORMAL (U"If a sound is computer-generated as a glottal source signal with a constant period, "
	"then filtered with the characteristics of a vocal tract configuration corresponding to a sustained vowel, "
	"and if then 1 percent additive \"white\" noise (a quite usual amount) is added, "
	"Praat will measure this sound as having a \"jitter\" of 0.02 percent, "
	"whereas MDVP will measure this sound as having a \"jitter\" of 0.6 percent. "
	"In other words, Praat will tell you that there is almost no jitter, "
	"whereas MDVP will tell you that the jitter is of an almost pathological level. "
	"The relevant curves can be seen in my papers \"Stemmen meten met Praat\" and @@Boersma (2009a)@, "
	"and the numbers are confirmed by Deliyski, Shaw & Evans (%%Journal of Voice%, 2005: 23).")
NORMAL (U"One can see that Praat's \"jitter\" measure attempts to separate the influence of period duration variation "
	"(which it reports as \"jitter\") from the influence of additive noise (which is does not report as \"jitter\"), "
	"and that MDVP's \"jitter\" measure combines the influence of period duration variation with the influence of additive noise "
	"(both of which it reports as \"jitter\").")
NORMAL (U"The difference between Praat's and MDVP's jitter measures is due to a difference between the way in which periods are measured. "
	"Praat uses %%waveform-matching%, in which the duration of a period is determined by looking for best matching wave shapes "
	"(a \"cross-correlation\" maximum). MDVP uses %%peak-picking% instead, where the duration of a period is determined by "
	"measuring the time difference between two locally highest peaks in the wave form. The waveform-matching method "
	"averages away much of the influence of additive noise, whereas peak-picking is highly sensitive to additive noise. "
	"For detailed illustrations, see @@Boersma (2009a)@.")
