"AmplitudeTier"
© Paul Boersma 2007

One of the @@types of objects@ in Praat.
An AmplitudeTier object represents a time-stamped amplitude contour,
i.e., it contains a series of (%time, %amplitude) points.
The amplitude values are in Pascal. To see some applications, consult the @IntensityTier information;
the difference between an AmplitudeTier and an IntensityTier is that the former has values in Pascal
which multiply linearly with a Sound (for instance), and the latter has values in dB,
which multiply logarithmically with a Sound.

################################################################################
"AmplitudeTier: Add point..."

I
A command to add a point to each selected @AmplitudeTier.

Settings
========
##Time (s)
: the time at which a point is to be added.

##Sound pressure (Pa)
: the amplitude value of the requested new point.

Behaviour
=========
The tier is modified so that it contains the new point.
If a point at the specified time was already present in the tier, nothing happens.

"Create AmplitudeTier..."
© Paul Boersma 2023

################################################################################
"Create DurationTier..."
© Paul Boersma 2014-04-21, 2023-04-30

A command in the @@New menu@ to create an empty @DurationTier object.
The resulting object will have the specified name and time domain, but contain no duration points.
To add some points to it, use @@DurationTier: Add point...@.

Example
=======
To create a tier 0.9 seconds long, with an deceleration around 0.6 seconds,
you do (either in a script or by choosing these 4 commands by hand):
{
	\#{Create DurationTier:} “dur”, 0, 0.9
	\@{DurationTier: ||Add point:} 0.3, 1
	Add point: 0.6, 2.3
	Add point: 0.7, 1
}
The result will look like
{- 5x2.5
	x# = { 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9 }
	y# = { 1.0, 1.0, 2.3, 1.0, 1.0 }
	Red
	Create Polygon from values: "durationTier", x#, y#
	Draw: 0.0, 0.9, 0.0, 2.5
	Black
	Draw inner box
	Marks left every: 1.0, 1.0, "yes", "yes", "no"
	Marks bottom every: 1.0, 0.1, "yes", "yes", "no"
	Text bottom: "yes", "Time (s)"
	Text left: "yes", "Relative duration"
}
The target duration will be the area under this curve, which is 0.9 + 1/2 · 1.3 · 0.4 = 1.16 seconds.

"Create Strings as folder list..."
© Paul Boersma 2006(with “directory list”),2020,2024

A command in the @@New menu@ to create a @Strings object containing a list of folders in a given parent folder.
It works completely analogously to @@Create Strings as file list...@.

Script usage
============
See @@Create Strings as file list...@.
If you don’t need the resulting @Strings object,
it may be easier to use @`folderNames$#` instead.

################################################################################
"Create Strings as directory list..."

A synonym for @@Create Strings as folder list...@.

You can see this command in older scripts, but not in Praat’s menus.
This command is kept for reasons of compatibility.

################################################################################
"Create Strings as file list..."
© Paul Boersma 1998,2006,2013-2015,2020,2024

A command in the @@New menu@ to create a @Strings object containing a list of files in a given folder.

Settings
========
{- 5.4x2.44
)~~~"
	Manual_DRAW_SETTINGS_WINDOW ("Create Strings as file list", 2.6)
	Manual_DRAW_SETTINGS_WINDOW_FIELD ("Name", "fileList")

R"~~~(
}

##Name
: the name of the resulting Strings object.

##File path
: the folder name, with an optional %wildcard (see below) for selecting files.

Behaviour
=========
The resulting Strings object will contain an alphabetical list of file names (by naïve Unicode-sorting),
without the preceding path through the folder structures. If there are no files that match the file path,
the Strings object will contain no strings.

Usage
=====
There are two ways to specify the file path.

One way is to specify a folder name only. On Unix, the file path could be
`/usr/people/miep/sounds` or `/usr/people/miep/sounds/`, for instance. On Windows,
`C:\Users\Miep\Sounds` or `C:\Users\Miep\Sounds\`.
On Macintosh, `/Users/miep/Sounds` or `/Users/miep/Sounds/`. Any of these produce
a list of all the files in the specified folder.

The other way is to specify a wildcard (a single asterisk) for the file names.
To get a list of all the files whose names start with “`hal`” and end in “`.wav`”,
type `/usr/people/miep/sounds/hal*.wav`, `C:\Users\Miep\Sounds\hal*.wav`,
or `/Users/miep/Sounds/hal*.wav`.

Script usage
============
In a script, you can use this command to cycle through the files in a folder.
For instance, to read in all the sound files in a specified folder,
you could use the following script:
{;
	folder$ = “/usr/people/miep/sounds”
	strings = \#{Create Strings as file list:} “list”, folder$ + “/*.wav”
	numberOfFiles = Get number of strings
	for ifile to numberOfFiles
		\`{selectObject}: strings
		fileName$ = Get string: ifile
		\@{Read from file:} folder$ + “/” + fileName$
	endfor
}
If the script has been saved to a script file, you can use file paths that are relative to the folder
where you saved the script. Thus, with
{;
	\#{Create Strings as file list:} “list”, “*.wav”
}
you get a list of all the `.wav` files that are in the same folder as the script that contains this line.
And to get a list of all the `.wav` files in the folder `Sounds` that resides in the same folder as your script,
you can do
{;
	\#{Create Strings as file list:} “list”, “Sounds/*.wav”
}
As is usual in Praat scripting, the forward slash (“/”) in this example can be used on all platforms, including Windows.
This makes your script portable across platforms.

Note that the above functionality can also be written three lines shorter, using built-in functions:
{;
	folder$ = “/usr/people/miep/sounds”
	list$# = \#`{fileNames$#}: folder$ + “/*.wav”
	for ifile to \`{size} (list$#)
		\@{Read from file:} folder$ + “/” + list$# [ifile]
	endfor
}
This doesn’t produce a Strings object.

/*
1. The Hilbert transform.

I wondered whether my use of taking the square was worse than taking
the Hilbert envelope. My formula is

   my_envelope1(t) = x(t) ^ 2

For a sampled signal, this introduces higher frequencies, so I should have
filtered the signal at half the Nyquist frequency to prevent aliasing. I wonder
how the Hilbert envelope behaves in this respect:

   your_envelope1(t) = x(t) ^ 2 + Px(t) ^ 2

I think it has the same problem, since it involves squaring the real and imaginary parts.

Of course, the Hilbert transform is much smoother, but that cannot matter for
frequencies above 100 Hz or so, since we are going to filter at 30 Hz anyway.
Thus, I think these methods are comparable. Do you agree?


2. The non-linearity.

In the second step, I take the logarithm:

   my_envelope2(t) = 10 log10 (my_envelope1(t) + 1e-6)

Of course, the 1e-6 is there to guard against zero values in my_envelope1.
I took the logarithm because it can handle negative values, which will arise
in the filtering process. You take the square root instead:

   your_envelope2(t) = sqrt (your_envelope1(t))


3. Filtering between 3 and 30 Hz.

You use a second-order Butterworth filter in the time domain:

   your_envelope3(t) = your_envelope2(t) * Butterworth(t)

What do you mean by "forward and backward filtering"?
Did you use the second-order filter twice, thus making it fourth-order effectively?

My alternative was to use the two Gaussians:

   my_spectrum2(f) = fft (my_envelope2(t))
   my_spectrum3(f) = my_spectrum2(f) (exp(-(f/35)^2)-exp(-(f/3.5)^2)
   my_envelope3(t) = ifft (my_spectrum3 (f))

This is a filter with several desirable properties: no ringing, phase-preserving,
an area of zero. On the other hand, it is not causal, but I think that that is not
an issue here. Is it?


4. The new band.

In my algorithm, I have to undo the non-linearity:

   my_envelope4(t) = 10 ^ (my_envelope3(t) / 2)

You see that I divide by 2, not 10, thus effectively multiplying the dynamics,
expressed in dB, by a factor of 5. Since I am going to use the new envelope as
a multiplication factor, I will have to limit it to a factor of 10, because the
maximum enhancement is 20 dB. But this limiting factor is band-dependent:

   ceiling(Fmid) = 1 + 9 (1/2 - 1/2 cos (pi Fmid / 13))

where Fmid is expressed in Bark. The limiting is done smoothly:

   my_envelope5(t) = 1 / (1 / my_envelope4(t) + 1 / ceiling)

So this is the final multiplication factor for the band-filtered signal:

   new_band(t) = x(t) my_envelope5(t)

Your multiplication factor is very different. Please tell me whether I am correct.

   your_envelope4(t) = rectify (your_envelope3(t))

This step is needed because you cannot handle negative values. It introduces
higher-frequency components, which will have to be filtered out later.
The new signal will have to carry the new envelope, so the multiplication
factor is taken relative to the envelope of the original signal:

   your_envelope5(t) = your_envelope4(t) / your_envelope2(t)

The components that were introduced by the rectification must be thrown out:

   your_envelope6(t) = your_envelope5(t) * Butterworth?(t)

What were the characteristics of that filter? You did not specify them in your paper.
Well, the next step is normalization to the power of the original band:

   new_band(t) = your_envelope6(t) ||x(t)|| / ||your_envelope5(t)||

At least, that's your formula (12). I suppose that it contains a mistake, and that
the norm in the denominator should refer to the filtered your_envelope6(t) instead?

By the normalization, the fast movements within each band have been strengtened,
and the slow parts have been weakened. Thus, there is dynamic expansion within
each band, whereas my algorithm has this only in the mid frequency range, am I correct?
Could you also explain figure 5 to me? Some of the thick curves show enhanced peaks,
but how about the valleys, are some of them deepened as well?


5. The new signal.

My algorithm simply adds all the bands:

   new_signal(t) = SUM new_band(Fmid,t)

The mid-frequency bands are favoured because they have stronger modulation deepening
than the other bands. In your algorithm, the favouring of the mid frequencies is
implemented in the last step:

   new_signal(t) = SUM new_band(Fmid,t) gain(Fmid)

This would mean, for instance, that if the modulation is not deepened (for instance
if there are no fast movements), the mid-frequency range is still multiplied by a factor
of 10, whereas my algorithm would not change the signal at all in such a case. Is that so?

If so, could any of the learning results have been produced by the general emphasis
in the 1-4 kHz range? Have you any proof that the modulation deepening itself
is the cause of the learning results?

So the differences between the two algorithms are clear now: mine does modulation
deepening selectively in the F2 range, yours does modulation deepening everywhere
plus an independent emphasis in the F2 range. Since both algorithms will lead to
emphasis in the F2 range, that leaves the question of whether a modulation change
is necessary for the other frequency bands. Have you any idea, or was your choice
for this just one of the minor decisions while constructing your algorithm?

To sum up, I think that both algorithms perform what they were intended to do,
namely selectively enhancing fast F2 transitions. If you agree with this, I may
advise XXX to use my algorithm without change. I would, however, welcome any
suggestions as to oversights in my implementation, or other possible problems
or incorrect choices.
