"how to choose a pitch analysis method"
© Paul Boersma 2023,2024

Pitch analysis is the determination of a pitch curve from a given sound.

In Praat you can choose from at least four methods for pitch analysis:
- @@pitch analysis by filtered autocorrelation
- @@pitch analysis by raw cross-correlation
- @@pitch analysis by raw autocorrelation
- @@pitch analysis by filtered cross-correlation

These method have been listed here in order of usefulness for the %average speech researcher:
for measuring vocal-fold vibration frequency or intonation,
you are advised to use @@pitch analysis by ||filtered autocorrelation@;
for voice analysis (such as is used in the area of voice pathology),
you are advised to use @@pitch analysis by ||raw cross-correlation@;
and for measuring pure periodicity,
you are advised to use @@pitch analysis by ||raw autocorrelation@.

Measuring intonation
====================

From 1993 to 2023, Praat’s preferred method for measuring intonation
(and for most use cases involving vocal-fold vibration) was
@@pitch analysis by ||raw autocorrelation@, and this is still available if you
want to measure raw periodicity (see below). From 2023 on,
Praat’s preferred method for measuring intonation
(and for most use cases involving vocal-fold vibration) has been
@@pitch analysis by ||filtered autocorrelation@.

All these methods measure pitch in terms of the self-similarity of the waveform.
If the waveform is almost identical if you shift it by 10 milliseconds in time,
then 100 Hz will be a good candidate for being the F0. This idea has been used in Praat from 1993 on,
using the "autocorrelation" and "cross-correlation" methods,
which are nowadays called "raw autocorrelation" and "raw cross-correlation".
Both methods measure self-similarity as a number between -1.0 and +1.0.
From 2023 on, we also have "filtered autocorrelation" and "filtered cross-correlation",
which use low-pass filtering of the waveform (by a Gaussian filter)
prior to doing autocorrelation or cross-correlation.

The filtering comes with several benefits:

- ##Filtering leads to fewer unwanted octave drops.# An unwanted octave drop can occur,
for instance, if you set the pitch floor to 75 Hz (the standard value for raw AC)
but the F0 is 200 Hz and there is background noise.
The waveshape will be self-similar over time shifts of 5 ms,
but then necessarily also over time shifts of 10 ms and 15 ms, and so on.
Background noise can sometimes randomly make the degree of self-similarity higher
over 10 ms than over 5 ms, leading to an octave drop in the measured pitch, from 200 to 100 Hz.
In raw AC and raw CC, this problem is alleviated a bit by applying an "octave cost",
whose standard setting is 0.01 per octave (on a self-similarity scale from 0.0 to 1.0).
However, low-pass filtering reduces the problem more strongly,
by taking away the higher-frequency parts of the background noise.
- ##Filtering leads to fewer unwanted octave rises.# If you set the pitch ceiling to 600 Hz
(the standard value), and the F0 is 150 Hz, and the F1 is 450 Hz,
then the harmonic relation between F0 and F1 (F1 is exactly three times F0)
will lead to a very strong F1 in the waveform, sometimes causing the pitch to be analysed
as 450 instead of 150 Hz. This problem is exacerbated by the existence of the “octave cost”,
which favours higher pitch candidates. Low-pass filtering reduces this problem,
because the 450-Hz component of the waveform is weakened with respect to the 150-Hz component
by a factor of 0.373 (if the pitch top is 800 Hz, and the “attenuation at top” is set to 0.03).
This effect is so strong that the standard “octave cost” can be much higher for filtered pitch analysis
(the standard value is 0.055 per octave) than for raw pitch analysis (where the standard value is 0.01 per octave):
this still reduces the formant problem heavily, and it reduces the unwanted octave drops
by making the analysis more resistent to %lower-frequency parts of the background noise.
- ##Filtering leads to better tracking of formant transitions.# Fast formant movements
in transitions between consonants and vowels cause waveforms to change their shape strongly in time.
This reduces the self-similarity of the waveform, leading to the “raw AC” method judging
some of these transitions as “unvoiced”. With low-pass filtering, the transitions become
more sine-like, which leads “filtered AC” being more likely to judge these transitions as “voiced”.

On a database containing EGG recordings as a gold standard (AtakeDB),
the incidence of unwanted big frequency drops falls from 0.54% (of voiced frames) for raw AC to 0.15% for filtered AC,
and the number of unwanted big frequency rises falls from 0.25% to 0.10% (of voiced frames);
together, these numbers indicate that the incidence of gross frequency errors is better
for filtered AC than for raw AC by a factor of more than 3.

On the other hand, low-pass filtering also produces potentially unwanted side effects:

- The reduction of higher frequency components causes voicing decisions to be based on smoother curves.
As this influences especially the loud parts (the vowels),
this reduction may have to lead to a higher optimal “silence threshold” setting.
Indeed, in testing the algorithm on AtakeDB,
the best silence threshold for filtered AC seems to be 0.18,
whereas for raw AC it seems to be 0.06. Accounting for recordings with a larger dynamic range than AtakeDB,
the current standard silence threshold is half that: 0.03 for raw AC, and 0.09 for filtered AC.
This can lead to more difficulty measuring plosive voicing (during prevoiced [b] or [d]);
if you want to measure those, then you are advised to lower the silence threshold
from the standard of 0.09 to e.g. 0.01 (this is also somewhat true for raw AC,
where the standard value is 0.03 but one should probably use 0.01 for prevoicing).
- Generalizingly, voicing decisions seem to be less predictable for filtered AC than for raw AC,
i.e. it is possible that the incidence of unvoiced-to-voiced errors and voiced-to-unvoiced errors is greater.
This may have to be shown in practice. In the future, voicing decisions may have to be relegated
to a trained neural network, rather than to the current simple “costs” and “thresholds”.

All in all, it seems likely that filtered AC works better in practice than raw AC
(your feedback is invited, though), which is why filtered AC is the preferred pitch analysis method
for vocal-fold vibration and intonation, as is shown in the Periodicity menu in the Objects window,
in the Pitch menu of the Sound window, and in many places in this manual.
While the standard pitch range for raw AC runs from 75 to 600 Hz,
filtered AC has less trouble discarding very low or very high pitch candidates,
so the standard pitch range for filtered AC is wider, running from 50 Hz to 800 Hz,
and may not have to be adapted to the speaker’s gender.

Voice analysis
==============

For voice analysis, we probably shouldn’t filter away noise, so @@pitch analysis by ||raw cross-correlation@ is the preferred method.

Measuring prevoicing
====================

The high standard “silence threshold” of 0.09 for filtered AC (or, to a lesser extent, 0.03 for raw AC)
probably leads to trouble measuring voicing during the closure phase of prevoiced plosives such as [b] or [d].
You are still advised to use filtered AC, but to lower the silence threshold to 0.01 or so.

Raw periodicity
===============

Mathematically generated periodic signals aren’t necessarily speechlike. For instance:
{
	sine = Create Sound from formula: "sine", 1, 0, 0.1, 44100, "0.4*sin(2*pi*200*x)"
	tricky = Create Sound from formula: "tricky", 1, 0, 0.1, 44100, "0.001*sin(2*pi*400*x)
	... + 0.001*sin(2*pi*600*x) - 0.2*cos(2*pi*800*x+1.5) - 0.2*cos(2*pi*1000*x+1.5)"
	selectObject: sine, tricky
	Concatenate
	Erase all
	Draw: 0.08, 0.12, 0, 0, "yes", "curve"
}
Both the left part of this sound and the right part have a period of 5 ms,
and therefore an F0 of 200 Hz. The @@pitch analysis by ||raw autocorrelation@ method measures an equally
strong pitch of 200 Hz throughout this signal, while @@pitch analysis by ||filtered autocorrelation@
considers the right part voiceless. This is because the right part contains
only components at 800 and 1000 Hz, which will be filtered out by the low-pass filter,
and only very small components at 200, 400 or 600 Hz.
This problem of the %%missing fundamental% was the reason why low-pass filtering
was not included in @@pitch analysis by ||raw autocorrelation@ in 1993. However,
this situation is %very rare in speech, so for speech we do nowadays recommend @@pitch analysis by ||filtered autocorrelation@,
while we recommend @@pitch analysis by ||raw autocorrelation@ only if you want to measure %raw periodicity.

Settings
========

The settings that control the recruitment of the candidates are:

##Time step (s)# (standard value: 0.0)
:	the measurement interval (frame duration), in seconds. If you supply 0.0,
Praat will use a time step of 0.75 / (%%pitch floor%), e.g. 0.01 seconds if the pitch floor is 75 Hz;
in this example, Praat computes 100 pitch values per second.

##Pitch floor (Hz)# (standard value: 75 Hz)
:	candidates below this frequency will not be recruited.
This parameter determines the length of the analysis window: it will be 3 longest periods long,
i.e., if the pitch floor is 75 Hz, the window will be 3/75 = 0.04 seconds long.

Note that if you set the time step to zero, the analysis windows for consecutive measurements
will overlap appreciably: Praat will always compute 4 pitch values
within one window length, i.e., the degree of %oversampling is 4.

##Pitch ceiling (Hz)# (standard value: 600 Hz)

© Paul Boersma 1996,2001–2003,2022-2024

Purpose
=======

to perform a pitch analysis based on an autocorrelation method.

Usage
=====

Raw autocorrelation is the pitch analysis method of choice if you want measure the raw periodicity of a signal.

Note that the preferred method for speech (intonation, vocal fold vibration) is @@pitch analysis by filtered autocorrelation@.
See @@how to choose a pitch analysis method@ for details.

Algorithm
=========

The algorithm performs an acoustic periodicity detection on the basis of an
accurate autocorrelation method, as described in @@Boersma (1993)@.
This method is more accurate, noise-resistant, and robust, than methods based on cepstrum or combs,
or the original autocorrelation methods. The reason why other methods were invented,
was the failure to recognize the fact that if you want to estimate a signal's short-term autocorrelation
function on the basis of a windowed signal, you should divide the autocorrelation function of the
windowed signal by the autocorrelation function of the window:

~	%r_%x (%\ta) \~~ %r__%xw_ (%\ta) / %r_%w (%\ta)

The pitch is basically determined as the inverse of the time (%lag) where the autocorrelation function %r)~~~" R"~~~(
has its maximum. However, there are likely to be multiple peaks in %r,
and all of these can be %%pitch candidates%. For each moment in time (e.g. every 10 ms),
the algorithm determines the (typically) 15 highest peaks in %r,
regards these as %candidates, and then tracks an optimal path through the candidates over time.

Settings
========

Several settings are already described in @@Intro 4.2. Configuring the pitch contour@.
The explanations below assume that you have gone through that part of the Intro.

The settings that control the recruitment of the candidates are:

##Time step (s)# (standard value: 0.0)
:	the measurement interval (frame duration), in seconds. If you supply 0,
Praat will use a time step of 0.75 / (%%pitch floor%), e.g. 0.01 seconds if the pitch floor is 75 Hz;
in this example, Praat computes 100 pitch values per second.

##Pitch floor (Hz)# (standard value: 75 Hz)
:	candidates below this frequency will not be recruited.
This parameter determines the effective length of the analysis window: it will be 3 longest periods long,
i.e., if the pitch floor is 75 Hz, the window will be effectively 3/75 = 0.04 seconds long.

Note that if you set the time step to zero, the analysis windows for consecutive measurements
will overlap appreciably: Praat will always compute 4 pitch values
within one window length, i.e., the degree of %oversampling is 4.

##Pitch ceiling (Hz)# (standard value: 600 Hz)
:	candidates above this frequency will be ignored.

##Max. number of candidates# (standard value: 15)
:	each frame will contain at least this many pitch candidates.
One of them is the “unvoiced candidate”; the others correspond to
time lags over which the signal is more or less similar to itself.

##Very accurate# (standard value: %off)
:	if %off, the window is a Hanning window with a physical length of  3 / (%%pitch floor%).
If %on, the window is a Gaussian window with a physical length of  6 / (%%pitch floor%),
i.e. twice the effective length.

A post-processing algorithm seeks the cheapest path through the candidates.
The settings that determine the cheapest path are:

##Silence threshold# (standard value: 0.03)
:	frames that do not contain amplitudes above this threshold (relative to the global maximum amplitude),
are probably silent.

##Voicing threshold# (standard value: 0.45)
:	the strength of the unvoiced candidate, relative to the maximum possible autocorrelation.
If the amount of periodic energy in a frame is more than this fraction of the total energy (the remainder being noise),
then Praat will prefer to regard this frame as voiced; otherwise as unvoiced.
To increase the number of unvoiced decisions, increase the voicing threshold.

##Octave cost# (standard value: 0.01 per octave)
:	degree of favouring of high-frequency candidates, relative to the maximum possible autocorrelation.
This is necessary because even (or: especially) in the case of a perfectly periodic signal,
all undertones of %F_0 are equally strong candidates as %F_0 itself.
To more strongly favour recruitment of high-frequency candidates, increase this value.

##Octave-jump cost# (standard value: 0.35)
:	degree of disfavouring of pitch changes, relative to the maximum possible autocorrelation.
To decrease the number of large frequency jumps, increase this value. In contrast with what is described
in the article, this value will be corrected for the time step: multiply by 0.01 s / %TimeStep to get
the value in the way it is used in the formulas in the article.

##Voiced / unvoiced cost# (standard value: 0.14)
:	degree of disfavouring of voiced/unvoiced transitions, relative to the maximum possible autocorrelation.
To decrease the number of voiced/unvoiced transitions, increase this value. In contrast with what is described
in the article, this value will be corrected for the time step: multiply by 0.01 s / %TimeStep to get
the value in the way it is used in the formulas in the article.

The standard settings are best in most cases.
For some pathological voices, you will want to set the voicing threshold to much less than the standard of 0.45,
in order to get pitch values even in irregular parts of the signal.
For prevoiced plosives, you may want to lower the silence threshold from 0.03 to 0.01 or so.

"pitch analysis by raw cross-correlation"
© Paul Boersma 1996,2003,2023,2024

Purpose
=======

to perform a pitch analysis based on a cross-correlation method.

Usage
=====

Raw cross-correlation is the pitch analysis method of choice if you want to do voice analysis (e.g. jitter, shimmer).

Note that the preferred method for speech (intonation, vocal fold vibration) is @@pitch analysis by filtered autocorrelation@.
Raw cross-correlation is mainly for experimenting,
or for applications where you need short time windows;
for this latter reason, it is also the standard method for voice analysis.

See @@how to choose a pitch analysis method@ for details.

Algorithm
=========

The algorithm performs an acoustic periodicity detection on the basis of a
forward cross-correlation analysis.

Settings
========

Several settings are already described in @@Intro 4.2. Configuring the pitch contour@.
The explanations below assume that you have gone through that part of the Intro.

##Time step (s)# (standard value: 0.0)
:	the measurement interval (frame duration), in seconds. If you supply 0,
Praat will use a time step of 0.25 / (%%pitch floor%), e.g. 0.00333333 seconds if the pitch floor is 75 Hz;
in this example, Praat computes 300 pitch values per second.

##Pitch floor (Hz)# (standard value: 75 Hz)
:	candidates below this frequency will not be recruited.
This parameter determines the length of the analysis window: it will be 1 longest period long,
i.e., if the pitch floor is 75 Hz, the window will be 1/75 = 0.01333333 seconds long.

Note that if you set the time step to zero, the analysis windows for consecutive measurements
will overlap appreciably: Praat will always compute 4 pitch values
within one window length, i.e., the degree of %oversampling is 4.

The other settings are the same as for @@pitch analysis by raw autocorrelation@.

"pitch analysis by filtered autocorrelation"
© Paul Boersma 2023,2024

A command that creates a @Pitch object from every selected @Sound object.

Purpose
=======

to perform a pitch analysis based on the autocorrelation of the low-pass filtered signal.

Usage
=====

Filtered autocorrelation is the pitch analysis method of choice if you want to measure intonation or vocal-fold vibration frequency.
See @@how to choose a pitch analysis method@ for details.

Algorithm
=========

This command will first low-pass filter the signal, then apply @@pitch analysis by raw autocorrelation@
on the filtered signal.

The low-pass filter is Gaussian in the frequency domain. If, for instance,
you set the %%pitch top% to 800 Hz, and the %%attenuation at top% to 0.03,
then the attenuation at 400 Hz is the fourth root of 0.03, i.e. about 42\% .
As a function of frequency %f, the attenuation is 0.03^^(%f/800)²^.
Here’s a table of attenuation factors, also in dB (in this logarithmic domain, the shape is parabolic):

| frequency | attenuation | logarithmic
|   100 Hz  |     0.95    |   -0.5 dB
|   200 Hz  |     0.80    |   -1.9 dB
|   300 Hz  |     0.61    |   -4.3 dB
|   400 Hz  |     0.42    |   -7.6 dB
|   500 Hz  |     0.25    |  -11.9 dB
|   600 Hz  |     0.14    |  -17.1 dB
|   700 Hz  |     0.07    |  -23.3 dB
|   800 Hz  |     0.03    |  -30.5 dB

Note: the attenuation curve will be identical to the curve shown here if you use a pitch top of 500 Hz
and an %%attenuation at top% of 0.25; however, this is not advised, because the example table
provides a more gradual suppression of higher pitches, almost as if there were no pitch top at all.

Settings
========

Several settings are already described in @@Intro 4.2. Configuring the pitch contour@.
The explanations below assume that you have gone through that part of the Intro.

The settings that control the recruitment of the candidates are:

##Time step (s)# (standard value: 0.0)
:	the measurement interval (frame duration), in seconds. If you supply 0,
Praat will use a time step of 0.75 / (%%pitch floor%), e.g. 0.015 seconds if the pitch floor is 50 Hz;
in this example, Praat computes 66.7 pitch values per second.

##Pitch floor (Hz)# (standard value: 50 Hz)
:	candidates below this frequency will not be recruited.
This parameter determines the effective length of the analysis window: it will be 3 longest periods long,
i.e., if the pitch floor is 50 Hz, the window will be effectively 3/50 = 0.06 seconds long.

Note that if you set the time step to zero, the analysis windows for consecutive measurements
will overlap appreciably: Praat will always compute 4 pitch values
within one window length, i.e., the degree of %oversampling is 4.

##Pitch top (Hz)# (standard value: 800 Hz)
:	candidates above this frequency will be ignored. Note, however, that candidates around one half of this (i.e. 400 Hz)
will already be reduced by 7.6 dB, i.e. they are already moderately disfavoured,
and that candidates around three-quarters of this (i.e. 600 Hz) will already be reduced by 17.1 dB,
i.e. they are strongly disfavoured. Hence, the %%pitch top%
needs to be be set much higher than the %%pitch ceiling% of @@pitch analysis by ||raw autocorrelation@,
which is why the standard is 800 Hz whereas the standard for raw autocorrelation can be 500 or 600 Hz.
To illustrate this, consider the search space for raw autocorrelation on the right (with a ceiling of 600 Hz)
and the search space for filtered autocorrelation on the right (with a top of 800 Hz):

We could say that the whole range from 300 to 800 Hz can be regarded as a skewed “ceiling”.
This is why we distinguish between the terms “ceiling” and “top”. If you have a speaker
with an especially high F0, then you can raise the top to e.g. 1200 Hz;
the attenuation of higher candidates will then have the exact same shape:

##Max. number of candidates# (standard value: 15)
:	each frame will contain at least this many pitch candidates.
One of them is the “unvoiced candidate”; the others correspond to
time lags over which the signal is more or less similar to itself.

##Very accurate# (standard value: %off)
:	if %off, the window is a Hanning window with a physical length of  3 / (%%pitch floor%).
If %on, the window is a Gaussian window with a physical length of  6 / (%%pitch floor%),
i.e. twice the effective length.

A pre-processing algorithm filters the sound before the @@pitch analysis by raw autocorrelation@ begins.
The shape of the attenutation curve is determined not only by the height of the %pitch top% (in hertz),
but also by how wide it is (in the pictures above, it’s the tiny horizontal linepiece at the top):

##Attenuation at top# (standard value: 0.03)
:	this is how much the frequency components of the original sound have been attenuated at the top.
In the example table above, you can see that at the top (800 Hz) the sounds was attenuated by a factor of 0.03.
We known of no reasons to change this value, except for experimenting.

A post-processing algorithm seeks the cheapest path through the candidates.
The settings that determine the cheapest path are:

##Silence threshold# (standard value: 0.09)
:	frames that do not contain amplitudes above this threshold (relative to the global maximum amplitude),
are probably silent.

##Voicing threshold# (standard value: 0.50)
:	the strength of the unvoiced candidate, relative to the maximum possible autocorrelation.
If the amount of periodic energy in a frame is more than this fraction of the total energy (the remainder being noise),
then Praat will prefer to regard this frame as voiced; otherwise as unvoiced.
To increase the number of unvoiced decisions, increase the voicing threshold.

##Octave cost# (standard value: 0.055 per octave)
:	degree of favouring of high-frequency candidates, relative to the maximum possible autocorrelation.
This is necessary because even (or: especially) in the case of a perfectly periodic signal,
all undertones of %F_0 are equally strong candidates as %F_0 itself.
To more strongly favour recruitment of high-frequency candidates, increase this value.

##Octave-jump cost# (standard value: 0.35)
:	degree of disfavouring of pitch changes, relative to the maximum possible autocorrelation.
To decrease the number of large frequency jumps, increase this value. In contrast with what is described
in the article (@@Boersma (1993)@), this value will be corrected for the time step: multiply by 0.01 s / %TimeStep to get
the value in the way it is used in the formulas in the article.

##Voiced / unvoiced cost# (standard value: 0.14)
:	degree of disfavouring of voiced/unvoiced transitions, relative to the maximum possible autocorrelation.
To decrease the number of voiced/unvoiced transitions, increase this value. In contrast with what is described
in the article, this value will be corrected for the time step: multiply by 0.01 s / %TimeStep to get
the value in the way it is used in the formulas in the article.

The standard settings are best in most cases.
For some pathological voices, you will want to set the voicing threshold to much less than the standard of 0.50,
in order to get pitch values even in irregular parts of the signal.
For prevoiced plosives, you may want to lower the silence threshold from 0.09 to 0.01 or so.
