"What's new?"
© Paul Boersma 1995–2024

Latest changes in Praat.

##6.4.16# (29 July 2024)
• Windows: make command-line output visible (new on ARM64, was lost in 6.4.14 for Intel64 and Intel32).

##6.4.15# (26 July 2024)
• Distinguish between %%pitch ceiling% (flat) and %%pitch top% (curved ceiling),
  mainly because of their different meanings.

##6.4.14# (22 July 2024)
• Pitch menu (in e.g. Sound or TextGrid window): separate settings for four pitch analysis methods.
• Formant analysis: faster on all systems.
• ARM64 Windows: worked around a compiler bug that caused incorrect window sizes.
• Pitch analysis: faster on Windows (Intel64 and Intel32).
• Windows: better fonts and background colours (perhaps dependent on language settings).
• ##TextGrids: Concatenate#: guard against some incorrect TexGrid files.

##6.4.13# (10 June 2024)
• More manual pages.
• @@Sounds: Concatenate with overlap...@: guard against a crash that would occur
  if the total overlap time was longer than the original sounds together.
• @`number` recognizes hexadecimal numbers again (bug since February 2023).

##6.4.12# (2 May 2024)
• ##Align interval#: fewer error messages.

##6.4.11# (26 April 2024)
• Menu commands that call a script (e.g. those that were added from a plug-in)
  are now visible as such by being marked with a little “+” sign.
• Fixed a bug that could cause the SpeechSynthesizer to mishandle European
  characters with accents on Linux.

##6.4.10# (21 April 2024)
• Function windows: fixed a problem that could cause Praat to crash when doing #all after #Group
  when windows had a different duration.

##6.4.09# (20 April 2024)
• TextGrid window: fixed a rare problem with ##Align interval# that could lead to a zero-length interval.
• Windows ARM64 edition: fixed a bug that would cause ##Align interval# to crash.
• ##Sound & TextGrid: Align interval...# now also available in the Objects window.

##6.4.08# (14 April 2024)
• Windows: fixed a problem with the right and bottom edges of windows (half-visible scroll bars)
	for the Intel editions (the ARM64 edition still has this problem).
• Scripting: fixed a bug that could cause Praat to crash when an unknown choice was given to an option menu.
• MelSpectrogram: fixed a bug that could cause Praat to crash if a mel value was negative.
• DataModeler: improved confidence limits on estimated model parameters.

##6.4.07# (17 March 2024)
• The command @@Sound & Pitch: To PointProcess (cc)@, which is also used when computing the times of pulses
  in the Sound window, could cause Praat to freeze when the pitch ceiling (and the measured pitch)
  were very high; this problem existed since at least 2001.
• eSpeak: new version, with e.g. Tigrinya.
• Support for 119-dpi graphics on Windows.
• Repaired a bug that could cause the Artword windows to crash if the Time field was left empty.

##6.4.06# (25 February 2024)
• Sound files on Windows: corrected a bug (existing since July 2021)
  that prevented reading FLAC files with special characters in their names.
• FormantPathEditor without Sound: corrected several bugs that caused Praat to crash (such as ##Formant listing#, using the Pitch menu...).
• Spectrogram painting: improved painting of very quiet spectrograms at extreme dynamic ranges.
• Scripting: @`folderExists`.
• Scripting: home-relative paths (such as `~/sounds/*.wav`) in more locations,
  such as @`fileNames$#`, @@Create Strings as file list...@, and @`createFolder`.

##6.4.05# (27 January 2024)
• Many typos in manual.
• Made TIMIT label files readable on Windows.
• Prevented 8000 files from being read at start-up.

• Saving sounds as MP3 files.

##6.4.01# (30 November 2023)
• Removed some visible percent signs before variable names from the scripting tutorial.
• SoundEditor/TextGridEditor logging: when logging 'f0',
  Praat now correctly reports values in Hz (rather than logarithms)
  if Unit is set to “Hertz (logarithmic)”.
  This bug had existed since Praat version 4.3.16 (June 2005).
• SoundEditor/TextGridEditor scripting compatibility: made old versions of “Pitch settings...”
  and “Advanced pitch settings...” available to scripts again, made the old denominations
  “autocorrelation” and “cross-correlation” (as pitch analysis methods) available to scripts again,
  and made obsolete versions of pitch analysis settings (such as “Pitch silence threshold”)
  available again, now under the COMPATIBILITY section of the output of “Editor info”.
  This will allow older editor scripts to continue to run without change.

##6.4# (15 November 2023)
• New pitch analysis methods: @@Sound: To Pitch (filtered ac)...@ and
  @@Sound: To Pitch (filtered cc)...@.
• @@Sound: To Pitch (filtered ac)...@ has become the preferred method for
  measuring vocal-fold vibration and intonation (@@Sound: To Pitch (raw cc)...@
  is still the preferred method for voice analysis).
  See @@how to choose a pitch analysis method@.

  ##Paste over selection# (Option-Command-V), and the already existing ##Paste after selection#
  (still Command-V).
• All editor windows: extended the old single-level Undo and Redo
  to a ten-level Undo and Redo.

Praat 4.3, 26 January 2005
==========================

General:
• #Apply button in settings windows for menu commands and in script forms.
• Info window can be saved.
• Removed 30,000-character limit in Info window.

Phonetics:
• Speeded up intensity analysis by a factor of 10
  (by making its time resolution 0.01 ms rather than 0.0001 ms at a sampling frequency of 44 kHz).
• Speeded up pitch analysis and spectrogram analysis by a factor of two.
• Sound: To Spectrum... now has a reasonably fast non-FFT version.
• Calibrated long-term average spectrum (Sound: To Ltas...).
• Pitch-corrected LTAS analysis.
• Sound: Scale intensity.
• PitchTier: To Sound (sine).
• Better warnings against use of the LPC object.

Voice:)~~~" R"~~~(
• July 9, 2004 (4.2.08): Shimmer measurements: more accurate and less sensitive to additive noise.
• More extensive voice report: pitch statistics; harmonicity.

Audio:
• Reading and opening 24-bit and 32-bit sound files (saving still goes in 16 bits).
• LongSound: save separate channels.
• Macintosh: much faster reading of WAV files.

Listening experiments:
• Subjects can now respond with keyboard presses.

Graphics:
• One can now drag the inner viewport in the Picture window, excluding the margins.
  This is nice e.g. for creating square viewports or for drawing a waveform and a spectrogram in close contact.
• Unix: picture highlighting as on Mac and Windows.
• More drawing methods for Sound and Ltas (curve, bars, poles, speckles).

OT learning:
• Monitor rankings when learning.
• OTGrammar: Remove harmonically bounded candidates...
• OTGrammar: Save as headerless spreadsheet file...
• Metrics grammar: added *Clash, *Lapse, WeightByPosition and *MoraicConsonant.

Scripting:
• nowarn, noprogress, nocheck.
• Line numbers.

Praat 4.2, 4 March 2004
=======================

General:
• July 10, 2003: Open source code (@@General Public License, version 3|General Public License@).

Phonetics:
• Faster computation of spectrum, spectrogram, and pitch.
• More precision in numeric libraries.
• PitchTier: Interpolate quadratically.
• TextGrids can be saved chronologically (and Praat can read that file again).
• Sound editor window @@Time step settings...@: #Automatic, #Fixed, and ##View-dependent#.
• Sound window: distinguish basic from advanced spectrogram and pitch settings.
• Read TableOfReal from headerless spreadsheet file...: cells with strings are considered zero.
• Sound window: introduced time step as advanced setting.
• Sound window: reintroduced view range as advanced setting.
• Ltas: Compute trend line, Subtract trend line.

Audio:
• Sun workstations: support audio servers.

Graphics:
• Better selections in Picture window and editor windows.
• Picture window: better handling of rectangles and ellipses for reversed axes.
• Windows: corrected positioning of pictures on clipboard and in metafiles.
• Windows: EPS files check availability of Times and TimesNewRomanPSMT.
• Polygon: can now also paint in colour instead of only in grey values.
• Unlimited number of points for polygons in PostScript (may not work on very old printers).
• Picture window: line widths on all printers and clipboards are now equal to line widths used on PostScript printers:
  a line with a line width of “1” will be drawn with a width 3/8 points. This improves the looks of pictures printed
  on non-PostScript printers, improves the looks of pictures copied to your wordprocessor when printed,
  and changes the looks of pictures copied to your presentation program.

OT learning:
• Metrics grammar supports “impoverished overt forms”,
  i.e. without secondary stress even if surface structures do have secondary stress.
• Support for crucially tied constraints and tied candidates.
• Support for backtracking in EDCD.
• Queries for testing grammaticality.

Scripting:
• ManPages: script links can receive arguments.
• ManPages: variable duration of recording.
• Support for unlimited size of script files in editor window on Windows XP and MacOS X (the Unix editions already had this).

"What was new in 3.5?"
© Paul Boersma 1997

Praat 3.5, 27 May 1997
======================

New editors:
• @TextGridEditor replaces and extends LabelEditor: edit points as well as intervals.
• @@ManipulationEditor|AnalysisEditor@ replaces and extends PsolaEditor: view pitch, spectrum, formant, and intensity
analyses in a single window, and allow pitch and duration resynthesis by overlap-add and more (would be undone in 3.9.19).
• @SpectrumEditor allows you to view and edit spectra.

Praat shell:
• @@History mechanism@ remembers all the commands that you have chosen,
and allows you to put them into a script.
• @ScriptEditor allows you to edit and run any Praat script, and to put it under a button.
• All added and removed buttons are remembered across sessions.
• #ButtonEditor allows you to make buttons visible or invisible.

Evaluations:
• In his 1996 doctoral thesis, Henning Reetz
compared five pitch analysis routines; @@Sound: To Pitch (ac)...@ appeared to make the fewest errors.
H. Reetz (1996): %%Pitch Perception in Speech: a Time Domain Approach%, Studies in Language and Language Use #26,
IFOTT, Amsterdam (ICG Printing, Dordrecht).

Documentation:
• 140 more man pages (now 330).
• Tables and pictures in manual.
• Printing the entire manual.
• Logo.

New types:
• Labelling & segmentation: @TextGrid, #IntervalTier, #TextTier.
• Analysis & manipulation: @@Manipulation|Analysis@.
• Statistics: @TableOfReal, @Distributions, #Transition

File formats:

"What was new in 3.3?"
© Paul Boersma 1996

Praat 3.3, 6 October 1996
=========================
• Documentation: hypertext help browser, including the first 190 man pages.
• New editors: type #TextTier for labelling times instead of intervals.
• New actions: #Formant: Viterbi tracker, Statistics menu, Scatter plot.
• Evaluation: For HNR analysis of speech, the cross-correlation method,
  which has a sensitivity of 60 dB and a typical time resolution of 12 milliseconds,
  must be considered better than the autocorrelation method,
  which has a better sensitivity (80 dB), but a much worse time resolution (30 ms).
  For pitch analysis, the autocorrelation method still beats the cross-correlation method
  because of its better resistance against noise and echos,
  and despite its marginally poorer resolution (15 vs. 12 ms).
• User preferences are saved across sessions.
• The phonetic X screen font included in the source code.
• Xwindows resources included in the source code
• Graphics: eight colours, small caps, text rotation.
• File formats: Sun/NexT mu-law files, raw matrix text files, Xwaves mark files.
• Accelerations: keyboard shortcuts, faster dynamic menu, Shift-OK keeps file selector on screen.
• Object type changes: #StylPitch and #MarkTier are now called @PitchTier and #TextTier, respectively.
  Old files can still be read.
• Script warning: all times in dialogs are in seconds now: milliseconds have gone.
